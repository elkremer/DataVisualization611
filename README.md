    The R script must be run using the R language. This can be done in a shell or a GUI environment such as RStudio. When running SenateExpenses.R, the function createExpensesByMonthAnimation will not work unless you register with plot.ly. The environment variables plotly_username and plotly_api_key are not set up in the Github version. The user will have to populate these variables with their own username and api key. Which can be obtained through the plot.ly website. 
    Once run, the visualizations will be created by the code. The function createSenatorChoroplethMap produces a file named choroplethUSSenateExpenses.pdf. The files can also be found on Github saved as .pdf files.
The original source of the data was http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2017/shp/cb_2017_us_state_5m.zip
